# Tags

Tags in CuratedCourses encompass topics, concepts, theorems,
definitions, learning outcomes, and standards, and thereby provide a
common mechanism for linking together content from one source with
content from another source which might nevertheless interest a
learner.

The taxonomy of tags is stored at [https://github.com/CuratedCourses/standards](https://github.com/CuratedCourses/standards).

## GET /v1/tags/

List all tags in CuratedCourses.

#### example request

    $ curl {{url_base}}/v1/tags/

      { "id": "CCSS.Math.Content.3.MD.B.3" },
      { "id": "CCSS.Math.Content.3.MD.B.4" },      
    ]

## GET /v1/tags/:tag

Note that there is no `DELETE` or `PUT` or `POST` verbs available for tags, because the only interface for editing the taxonomy is [https://github.com/CuratedCourses/standards](https://github.com/CuratedCourses/standards).

#### example request

    $ curl {{url_base}}/v1/tags/CCSS.Math.Content.MD.B.4
